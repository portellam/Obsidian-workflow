## 1. Introduction
![image](images/example.png)

As promised to quite a few people on different places, here is the author's
Obsidian workflow template. It has many cool features, of which solve issues
people have:

1. Daily and Periodic notes. Tasks and project management with journaling,
workout logging and media tracking.

2. Read-it-later with automated conversion to markdown and import inside your
vault. Meaning all your past knowledge is inside Obsidian, available with a
simple search alongside your notes.

3. Fast and simple one click upload obsidian publish alternative.

But there‚Äôs plenty more. It took the author some time here and there during the
past year (2021) to come up with this setup. And don‚Äôt worry, it is
**easy to use** despite its awfully long name.

Obviously, it is merely just a starting point, with Obsidian you can (and you
always should) do something that works well for **you**. And that means creating
your **own** setup. But that doesn‚Äôt forbid you from using this one as a
starting-point.

## 4. Support
Word from the [original author](https://github.com/mathisgauthey/obsidian-workflow-template):

---

I believe in a world where every software has an open-source alternative
maintained by a group of great people to improve everyone's life, and not
a company seeking only profits with high margins.

That's why I open-source almost all my projects and try to help as much as
possible the people who need help using these projects. Of course, all of this
takes time, time that I'm willing to spend so that you can use all of this for
free.

However, if you use my projects and find them useful, if you want to encourage
me to continue creating stuff, or if you believe in the same ideal as I do, it
is possible for you to support me to keep the machine running.

Thanks a lot, and make sure to have fun in life o/
