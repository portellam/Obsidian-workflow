### 1. Introduction
![image](media/example.png)

As promised to quite a few people on different places, here is the author's
Obsidian workflow template. It has many cool features, of which solve issues
people have:

1. Daily and Periodic notes. Tasks and project management with journaling,
workout logging and media tracking.

2. Read-it-later with automated conversion to markdown and import inside your
vault. Meaning all your past knowledge is inside Obsidian, available with a
simple search alongside your notes.

3. Fast and simple one click upload obsidian publish alternative.

But there‚Äôs plenty more. It took the author some time here and there during the
past year (2021) to come up with this setup. And don‚Äôt worry, it is
**easy to use** despite its awfully long name.

Obviously, it is merely just a starting point, with Obsidian you can (and you
always should) do something that works well for **you**. And that means creating
your **own** setup. But that doesn‚Äôt forbid you from using this one as a
starting-point.
